#summary Stuff to to and ideas for future releases. Feel free to comment
#labels Phase-Implementation
= Introduction =

This is some stuff for the new developers to do. Any of the devs can add more stuff if you please.

Please remember that I'm currently not working with DanPriest even though I'm writing this. It's just to get you started, and I will follow the development. But atm I'm writing other programs and doing other stuff. I'm even using Vista 64 so I can't install glider.

= Details =

  * I hear that the is some compatibility issues with DanPriest and the newest glider version, this has to be looked into right away.
  * Make DanPriest compatible with the new keys system
  * Fix any bugs you might find or know about
  * Implement features if you please, but if it's a big thing, you should ask me first.
