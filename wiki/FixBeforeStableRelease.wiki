Version 1.2 will soon be released, and is supposed to be the stable version to fall back on if something fails. So, this is a list of stuff that has to be fixed before I can release it. Feel free to comment.

*Bold* means important. _italic_ means not so important
  * *OOM checks!*   //Use IsKeyEnabled
  * *GSpellTimer for SW: P, to prevent double-cast*
  * Improve simple-healing
  * Fix our super awesome healing-algorithm to be less heal-loving
  * _Add code to detect chance of getting add on pull (look at Parrior)_
  * More Log()
  * _Random cast sequence_
  * _Handle mutliple adds_
  * *When done with add, must kill the next one insta, no pausing!*
  * *Right before getting aggro on pull, check for anything else closer*
