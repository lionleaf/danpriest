#summary A few words about what I want with DanPriest

= Introduction =

A few guidelines to follow for the developers, and my goal with DanPriest


= Details =

DanPriest should be a flexible class, where the user can make it fit every need.

DanPriest should be easy to get to work in a basic manner, but still contain a lot of advanced options to tweak your xp/hour, meaning that all the advanced options should have sensible defaults and should not be needed to adjusted.

The fundamental part of DanPriest is the customizable casting-sequence, and I wish to maintain a fully configurable combat sequence!

DanPriest is focused around effeciency, and is to be kept that way.
