(The last four on Bar 6 you have to set yourself under the Common. Keys)

Written by Sleepyshot (thanks again)


To-do:
- Improve PvP (Think it works pretty well atm, goal is to be able to win over people in duels outside orgrimmar :) This can always be improved :D )
- Make it detect elites and waste more mana on them
- Improve the add-control even more, spam mindflay when at range after the psychic scream.
- Shackle undead
- Fade
- Support for more racial spells, but for this I need help from people who play those races. Please post a description of how you would like it to work, and I'll see if I can implement it
- BE racials. (know how they work)
- Your suggestions here!
- Sure there is more, but can't think of anything right now.



Additional notes:
[B]I`ve made a mailing list now, since there is maybe an update to this class once a week or once a month, you wont be checking in all day. Therefore I`ve made a free mailinglist so I can send you all a mail when there is a update, so you wont need to check in on this thread all the time.
Subscribe here: [url]http://server.com/WebApps/mail-list-subscribe.cgi?list=82184[/url] 
Unsubscribe here: [url]http://server.com/WebApps/mail-list-unsubscribe.cgi?list=82184[/url] [/B]
[I]I do not take responsibility if this list sends out some some additional advertisment, though I highly doubt it will. It looks pretty OK. An there is even a unsubscribe thingie! This is the first time I`ve tried it, but I hope it works fine!
What I can guaranty you is that I wont send out any advertisment myself or abuse your information by selling my lis to other third-parties. But hey, this list wont be big enough to be worth more than a few bucks... You can feel safe that I wont abuse it!

EDIT: It turned out that they gave me a premium account for 1 day. As I'm not willing to pay money for it, it means three things. A banner in each mail I think. Dunno size or anything, havn't sent out anything yet. Some adds on subscribe site. And mails will be sent out by midnight. Meaning that after a update you will have a mail right after midnight. This is what they say about it, haven't tested yet though[/I]

--------------------------------------How to update--------------------------
[list=1]
[*]Download the newest edition
[*]Extract it to the same place as the old files (overwrite it all, though Gconfig.dll is not necessary  to overwrite, it doesn't hurt you)
[*]Open the class tab in the glider options, check the new one (or if the name is the same, press Test Compile)
[*]Delete the old .cs file (if you like... it doesn't really matter)
[*]Open the options menu and fill in anything that is new and check that it looks OK
[*]Start gliding!
